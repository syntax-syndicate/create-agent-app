### Mastra Framework

**Always use the Mastra MCP for learning:**

- The Mastra MCP server provides real-time documentation
- Ask it questions about Mastra APIs and best practices
- Follow Mastra's recommended patterns for agent development

**When implementing agent features:**
1. Consult the Mastra MCP: "How do I [do X] in Mastra?"
2. Use Mastra's built-in agent capabilities
3. Follow Mastra's TypeScript patterns and conventions
4. Leverage Mastra's integration ecosystem

**Initial setup:**
1. Use \`pnpx mastra init\` to create a new mastra project.
2. Then explore the setup it created, the folders, remove what not needed
3. Proceed with the user definition request to implement the agent and test it out
4. Open the UI for user to see using \`pnpx mastra dev\`
